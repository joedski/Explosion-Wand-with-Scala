Explosion Wand in Scala!
========================

I implemented the Explosion Wand mod in beginner Scala!  And learned how to set the build.gradle file to actually compile the Scala.

## Requirements

- Forge for Minecraft 1.7.2
- An IDE

## Scala

Scala!

Scala...

SCALA!

I also added some extra bits to my utils class to work with Scala objects.  I should probably split that into its own project...
